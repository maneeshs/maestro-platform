{"name":"Maestro Platform","tagline":"A scalable control platform writen in Java which supports OpenFlow switches","body":"Maestro is an \"operating system\" for orchestrating network control applications. Maestro provides interfaces for implementing modular network control applications to access and modify state of the network, and coordinate their interactions. Maestro is a platform for achieving automatic and programmatic network control functions using these modularized applications. Although this project focuses on building an OpenFlow controller using Maestro, Maestro is not only limited to OpenFlow networks. The programming framework of Maestro provides interfaces for:\r\n\r\n* Introducing new customized control functions by adding modularized control components.\r\n* Maintaining network state on behalf of the control components.\r\n* Composing control components by specifying the execution sequencing and the shared network state of the components.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Maestro tries to exploit parallelism within a single machine to improve the system's throughput performance. The fundamental feature of an OpenFlow network is that the controller is responsible for every flow's initial establishment by contacting related switches. Thus the performance of the controller could be the bottleneck. In designing Maestro we try to require as little effort from programmers as possible to manage the parallelization. Instead Maestro handles most of the tedious and complicated job of managing work load distribution and worker threads scheduling. By design Maestro is both portable and scalable:\r\n\r\n* Developed in Java (both the platform and the components) - Highly portable to various operating systems and architectures.\r\n* Multi-threaded - Takes full advantage of multi-core processors.\r\n\r\nMaestro currently provides the control components for realizing either a learning switch network, or a routed network using OpenFlow switches. Some components such as the command line console, etc, are still not full-fledged. We plan to further enrich and enhance the functionality of Maestro in future releases.
